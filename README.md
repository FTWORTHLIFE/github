One last meal at Cosmic Café was on 17 October 2021. It is was situated on Oak Lawn Avenue. This place started just randomly over a cup of chai when Kumar Pallana and Parveen Sachdev met. Cosmic Cafe has been serving the people of Dallas for over a quarter of the century. There have been a lot of people visiting this café over the years and seeing it close is quite sad for most people.
